# mach-zehnder-simulation

This is a simulation of the famous Mach-Zehnder Interferometer. 
It's was thought to serve as a additional help on a Quantum Mechanics class, 
since one can discuss the nature of light and the wave-particle duality in a much simpler manner.

A teaching sequence of wave-particle duality using this simulation was proposed in my master's degree thesis, if anyone got interested.
